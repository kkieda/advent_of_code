    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part One\n",
    "\n",
    "You come across a field of [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent) on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "They tend to form in _lines_; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby <span title=\"Maybe they're Bresenham vents.\">lines of vents</span> (your puzzle input) for you to review. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0,9 -> 5,9\n",
    "    8,0 -> 0,8\n",
    "    9,4 -> 3,4\n",
    "    2,2 -> 2,1\n",
    "    7,0 -> 7,4\n",
    "    6,4 -> 2,0\n",
    "    0,9 -> 2,9\n",
    "    3,4 -> 1,4\n",
    "    0,0 -> 8,8\n",
    "    5,5 -> 8,2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format `x1,y1 -> x2,y2` where `x1`,`y1` are the coordinates of one end the line segment and `x2`,`y2` are the coordinates of the other end. These line segments include the points at both ends. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   An entry like `1,1 -> 1,3` covers points `1,1`, `1,2`, and `1,3`.\n",
    "*   An entry like `9,7 -> 7,7` covers points `9,7`, `8,7`, and `7,7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, _only consider horizontal and vertical lines_: lines where either `x1 = x2` or `y1 = y2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "    .......1..\n",
    "    ..1....1..\n",
    "    ..1....1..\n",
    "    .......1..\n",
    "    .112111211\n",
    "    ..........\n",
    "    ..........\n",
    "    ..........\n",
    "    ..........\n",
    "    222111....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, the top left corner is `0,0` and the bottom right corner is `9,9`. Each position is shown as _the number of lines which cover that point_ or `.` if no line covers that point. The top-left pair of `1`s, for example, comes from `2,2 -> 2,1`; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines `0,9 -> 5,9` and `0,9 -> 2,9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine _the number of points where at least two lines overlap_. In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a `2` or larger - a total of _`5`_ points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. _At how many points do at least two lines overlap?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part Two\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, considering only horizontal and vertical lines doesn't give you the full picture; you need to also consider _diagonal lines_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the limits of the hydrothermal vent mapping system, the lines in your list will only ever be horizontal, vertical, or a diagonal line at exactly 45 degrees. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   An entry like `1,1 -> 3,3` covers points `1,1`, `2,2`, and `3,3`.\n",
    "*   An entry like `9,7 -> 7,9` covers points `9,7`, `8,8`, and `7,9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering all lines from the above example would now produce the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1....11.\n",
    "    .111...2..\n",
    "    ..2.1.111.\n",
    "    ...1.2.2..\n",
    "    .112313211\n",
    "    ...1.2....\n",
    "    ..1...1...\n",
    "    .1.....1..\n",
    "    1.......1.\n",
    "    222111....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You still need to determine _the number of points where at least two lines overlap_. In the above example, this is still anywhere in the diagram with a `2` or larger - now a total of _`12`_ points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider all of the lines. _At how many points do at least two lines overlap?_"
